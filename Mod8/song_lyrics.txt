Images of broken glass all red
I think those broken pieces are
all that remains
of my heart
can't concentrate on myself
there is nothing anymore
isolated,
ignored
sharp fragments all over the city
remind me you're not with me
I am only imagining
you can sympathize
and realize
I want to gather it again
if you'll only let me
rebuild
